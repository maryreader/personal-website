summary: "In the UK, child benefit can be claimed as soon as a birth is
  registered. But what if payments began earlier? Mary Reader has been
  researching the impact of a previous government grant to pregnant women. She
  finds that a small sum could lead to significant improvements in babiesâ€™
  health."

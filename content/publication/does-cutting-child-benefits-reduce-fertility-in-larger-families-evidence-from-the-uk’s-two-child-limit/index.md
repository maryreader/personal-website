abstract: We study the fertility effects of restricting child-related social
  assistance to the first two children in the family. As of April 2017, all
  third and subsequent children born to low-income families in the UK were made
  ineligible for approximately 3000 GBP of means-tested child benefits per year.
  We leverage administrative births microdata to estimate the impact of the
  two-child limit on higher-order births with a triple differences approach. We
  find some suggestive evidence of a decline in higher-order fertility among
  low-income families. However, effects are not statistically significant and
  compared to previous research in the UK and elsewhere, the implied
  elasticities are small.

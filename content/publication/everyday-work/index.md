abstract: "This report draws on a series of interviews with workers in the
  everyday economy conducted in Wakefield in the summer of 2019. It reflects on
  the state of work in the everyday economy in modern Britain and how Labour
  should embark on approach that would improve wages and working conditions, as
  well as empower ordinary workers. The strategy should, the report argues, be a
  key part of rebuilding support following the partyâ€™s General Election defeat
  in December 2019. Sectors like care, retail, and many of our public services
  are the backbone of all our communities, but too often workers within them are
  under-appreciated and have suffered from deteriorating pay and conditions. The
  paper concludes that Labour needs an agenda for improving modern, everyday
  work found in every part of the country, particularly in areas still impacted
  by the legacy of deindustrialization. "

abstract: Over a decade ago, in April 2009, the UK Labour government introduced
  the Health in Pregnancy Grant (HPG), a cash transfer of the equivalent of
  child benefit over the third trimester (£190) as a lump sum to all pregnant
  women in the United Kingdom. As a labelled, universal and unconditional cash
  transfer with near-universal take-up, the HPG remains the only international
  example of paying the equivalent of child benefit during pregnancy to improve
  health outcomes at birth. The grant was designed to improve birthweight by
  helping mothers afford high-quality nutrition and reducing stress in the
  prenatal phase. In January 2011, the HPG was abolished by the
  Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition on grounds, in part, that it was a
  “gimmick” with little evidence of impact on birthweight. This CASEpaper
  quantitatively evaluates the impact of the HPG on birthweight in England and
  Wales. Using administrative birth registrations data, I implement a
  quasi-experimental regression discontinuity (RD) design based on an arbitrary
  eligibility rule for the HPG. I find that the HPG was responsible for an
  increase of 11g in birthweight on average and that effects were concentrated
  on the smallest babies. Increases in birthweight were largest for younger
  mothers aged 25 and under (29g average increase) and mothers living in areas
  with high levels of deprivation (20g average increase). While younger mothers
  experienced a reduction in the probability of low birthweight by 0.9
  percentage points (12 percent in relative terms), low birthweight did not fall
  for the population as a whole. My findings suggest that paying the equivalent
  of universal child benefits in pregnancy as a labelled lump sum can
  disproportionately benefit disadvantaged groups such as younger mothers and
  lead to effect sizes that are larger than would be expected of more general
  windfall increases in income.

abstract: "This paper takes advantage of a unique policy experiment in the UK to
  estimate the impact of paying a universal child benefit during pregnancy.
  Using administrative birth registrations microdata from England and Wales, I
  evaluate the impact of the Health in Pregnancy Grant, a universal and
  short-lived policy that paid the equivalent of child benefit in a lump sum to
  all pregnant mothers from 2009 to 2011. I exploit an arbitrary eligibility
  rule to implement a regression discontinuity design in the date of birth of
  the child. I find that the policy led to increases in mean birthweight at
  population level. Effects were largest for the smaller babies, youngest
  mothers and those living in deprived areas. My findings suggest that there are
  significant health returns to paying universal child benefits during pregnancy
  and that the potential for birthweight gains from windfall increases in income
  is larger than previously thought. "

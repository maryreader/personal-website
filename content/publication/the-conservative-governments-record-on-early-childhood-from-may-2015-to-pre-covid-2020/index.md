abstract: "This paper uses the Social Policies and Distributional Outcomes
  framework to evaluate the record of successive Conservative administrations on
  early childhood during the period between 2015 and the eve of the COVID-19
  pandemic in February 2020. The paper covers services and benefits for families
  with children under five, with a focus on England. The paper analyses early
  childhood policies and goals during this period, the level and distribution of
  public spending on services and benefits, and their impact on inputs (such as
  staff qualifications), outputs (such as take-up of early education and
  childcare) and outcomes (such as gaps in early cognitive development). The
  paper points to a mixed record on policies for young children and their
  families: there was progress on improving childcare affordability, but little
  action on childcare quality, while Sure Start children’s centres continued to
  be squeezed and cash benefits were cut. Overall, spending on young children
  fell and became less progressive. By 2020 inequalities had widened in a range
  of early child outcomes, including child poverty, low birthweight and child
  obesity. This left early childhood – and inequalities within it in particular
  – in a precarious position on the eve of the COVID-19 pandemic."

abstract: Child benefits are typically paid on a per-child basis, without
  restrictions on family size. In this paper we generate unique evidence on the
  effects of capping child benefits by family size by examining the introduction
  of the UK’s ‘two-child limit’, which restricts means-tested child benefits to
  just two children per family. The UK government justified this policy on
  grounds that it would incentivise employment among larger families. We use
  mixed methods – combining quasi-experimental quantitative techniques and
  qualitative longitudinal research – to investigate the policy’s employment
  effects. We find no evidence that capping child benefits increases employment.
  Labour market activity among larger families seem to be particularly ‘sticky’
  in response to reductions in benefits income, likely due to parents’
  commitment to unpaid care, the scale of caregiving responsibilities and
  barriers to paid work. Our qualitative evidence also indicates that the
  effects of negative income shocks can render such policies counter-productive
  by pushing people further away from the labour market.

  This paper offers an empirical account of the changing landscape of private
  and public welfare activity in England over the forty years prior to the
  Covid-19 pandemic. It forms a part of the Social Policies and Distributional
  Outcomes in a Changing Britain research programme and it builds on a
  methodology devised by John Hills in 1997 and subsequently taken forward by
  him and successive CASE researchers. The variation in governmental ideologies,
  aims and policies with regards to the welfare state, and the balance between
  public and private actors within it, has been significant over the last four
  decades. But we argue that against a background of strong overall increases in
  demand for welfare of all kinds, policy changes have in practice produced a
  consistent direction of travel: away from a “pure public” collective model of
  financing, providing and decision-making, towards individualised
  responsibility and private provision. Although high-profile reforms have often
  produced underwhelming changes in actual shares of expenditure between
  different kinds of welfare activity, incremental changes have de facto
  redesigned the architecture of the welfare settlement.

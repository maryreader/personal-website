  The Education Policy Institute (EPI) has published its Annual Report on the
  state of education in England, including the attainment gap between
  disadvantaged pupils and their peers. 


  Education in England: Annual Report 2020, which is published in partnership with the Fair Education Alliance (FEA) and Unbound Philanthropy, also examines the gap at a local level, across different school subjects, and among different groups of pupils – including by varying levels of disadvantage.


  The new report finds that:


  The attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers has stopped closing for the first time in a decade. Policymakers have not succeeded in responding to earlier reports warning of a major loss of momentum in closing the gap.

  Disadvantaged pupils in England are 18.1 months of learning behind their peers by the time they finish their GCSEs – the same gap as five years ago.

  The gap at primary school increased for the first time since 2007 – which may signal that the gap is set to widen in the future.

  The stalling of the gap occurred even before the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted the education system.

  Researchers have identified the increasing proportion of disadvantaged children in persistent poverty as a contributory cause of the lack of progress with narrowing the disadvantage gap.

date: 2021-11-10T15:26:32.140Z
summary: Research using quasi-experimental techniques to isolate the causal
  impact of recent welfare reforms in the UK â€“ notably the two-child limit,
  which restricts social assistance to two children in a household, and the
  benefit cap, which sets an arbitrary limit on the amount of benefits income
  for which households are eligible.

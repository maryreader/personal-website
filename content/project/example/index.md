What is motivating this project? 
 

Larger families have always faced a disproportionate risk of poverty. Two recent welfare reforms (the household benefit cap, which limits the benefit income a household can receive, and the two-child limit, which restricts eligibility for child-benefits to two children) are expected to exacerbate this risk even further. These reforms also break with precedent in the social security system by severing the link between assessed need and entitlement to support. Despite the significance of these changes, there are important gaps in our understanding of i) how the reforms are affecting patterns of poverty; ii) how families themselves are responding to the changes, and iii) whether they are affecting wider well-being. There is some early analysis of these policies but the available evidence is small-scale and incomplete. While the policies are already affecting an increasing numbers of families, they have yet to be formally evaluated.

 This project adopts a multi-method nested research design to explore: 

How has the profile of poverty been affected by the two-child limit and benefits cap? Using large-scale data, we will describe the socio-economic circumstances, ethnicity and geography of larger families, and examine the extent to which the changes have increased the risk and depth of poverty for particular groups, and have reduced the effectiveness of the social security system in protecting households when a new baby is born. We will use smaller families as a reference point but our primary focus will be on larger families.

How are families coping? Qualitative longitudinal research (QLR) will follow 44 larger families over 18 months – interviewing primary caregivers at three points in time – as they experience the changing welfare policy context. The research will be conducted across two case study sites, Bradford and London, and will be underpinned by a robust purposive sampling strategy. QLR will generate dynamic, textured evidence on how larger families are affected by welfare reform, feeding into the quantitative analyses in later phases of the project and grounding them in lived experiences. 

Has wider well-being of affected families been harmed? We will examine effects of the reforms on parental mental health and (if sample sizes allow) children’s self-reported well-being, using time series and difference-in-differences models. Flexibility will be built into this stage to facilitate analyses of unanticipated consequences emerging from the QLR and the insights of families themselves, as well as in response to potential data limitations. 

The project will deliver timely and policy relevant evidence on the impact of the two-child limit and benefit cap on affected families. We will work closely with project policy partner – Child Poverty Action Group – to share findings from the project, and are also working in close collaboration with the councils of Bradford, Greenwich and Tower Hamlets. 

Overall, the project will adopt a mixed-methods approach to develop new insight into the impact of two reforms, which radically reshape social security provision and eligibility in the UK, delivering a greater understanding of the changing poverty profile and risk faced by families with more than two children.
